This project serves as a practical exercise, created by following an official LangGraph tutorial. It was undertaken with the objective of gaining hands-on experience and a foundational understanding of the framework's key principles. By completing this project, I aimed to enhance my proficiency with tools and frameworks essential for developing applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).
